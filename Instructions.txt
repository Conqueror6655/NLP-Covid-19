Please follow these instructions to successfully run my ipynb notebooks or py files:

1) The the first file covid-dataset.ipynb or py was created on kaggle in order to get few thousand articles from whole dataset.
	- So it will not run unless you run on kaggle (due to input path errors), the output of this notebook was a .csv file 

	- This "covid_data.csv"  is the output filename which is present in Data folder.

	- Link to that kernel "https://www.kaggle.com/conqueror6655/covid-dataset"

2) The second file Covid-19 Sentence similarity.ipynb or py was created on jupyter notebook, this is the heart of the project since in this
   file we do EDA, preprocessing, modeling and loading those models.

	- First thing is to setup the folder in which you run this notebook

	- Download Saved_models zip from the Google drive link provided in the report
	
	- Unzip that file and put Saved_models folder into the current working directory and if you want check the Repository.png 

3) In case you want to run .py file then please copy paste them in their parent folder(a1838670_code) since all path will be wrong if you keep them in "Py file" folder

Please see the repository.png (It shows which all files/folders needs to be present in order for 2nd notebook to run )

I Recommend using ipynb for seeing the working and py files for checking on turnitin.
